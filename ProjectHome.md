MyPolice is an online feedback tool that enables the public and the police to have a conversation. It fosters constructive, collaborative communication between people and the Police forces which serve them.

MyPolice helps communities identify weaknesses and opportunities in Police services. In providing analysis and data for the Police to act on, MyPolice challenges policy decisions that are made and ensuring that service users have an active part in changing the Police for the better.

You can give your opinion at a time when you feel strongly about an encounter with the Police and feel that the service offered by the Police could be improved. Itâ€™s the place where you can see how your thoughts translate directly into action.

MyPolice is where the public can find out what's really going on in their community in terms of crime and beating crime, because it's the only place where the Police and Joe Bloggs are on an equal footing to talk about the issues at a time when the public are sceptical of the 'independence' of the Police's processes. The Police are under increasing pressure to meet new, intangible targets to overcome the sentiment against them.

Snook have spent the last four months becoming the focus of Police organisations as they attempt to improve their 'customer service' to communities, meeting with every Police-related force, organisation and federation, generating positive leads and invitations to keynote national policing conferences
